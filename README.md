# Quiz-Application
This Java-based quiz application models multiple-choice questions using the Quiz class, which stores the question, options, and correct answer. Users input their answers, which are validated case-insensitively, with feedback provided for correct responses. The program calculates the final score, making it easy to extend by adding more Quiz objects.
